# ⚠️ STOP - Do Not Use This Template for Security Issues!

## For Security Vulnerabilities

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities using public issues!**

Instead, use one of these secure methods:

### 1. GitHub Security Advisories (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://github.com/ashsaym/ai-code-reviewer/security/advisories
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the private security advisory form

### 2. Private Email
Contact the maintainers privately through GitHub's email system.

## Why Private Reporting?

Public disclosure of security vulnerabilities can:
- Put users at risk before a fix is available
- Be exploited by malicious actors
- Violate responsible disclosure practices

## What Happens Next?

1. We'll acknowledge your report within 48 hours
2. We'll investigate and work on a fix
3. We'll coordinate a security release
4. You'll be credited in the security advisory (unless you prefer anonymity)

## For Non-Security Issues

If this is not a security vulnerability, please close this issue and:
- Use the **Bug Report** template for bugs
- Use the **Feature Request** template for enhancements
- Open a **Discussion** for questions
